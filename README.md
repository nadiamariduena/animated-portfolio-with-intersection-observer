#### To create this project I am going to use the INTERSECTION OBSERVER.

## FADE IN - FADE OUT ANIMATION with INTERSECTION OBSERVER

<p>
 Yesterday i created a mini portfolio
using AOS library (which offers nice animations) but i felt like with Intersection Observer i had more control over the threshold, since i already had some familiarity with Intersection Observer in vanilla JS, i felt
curious about the way it would look in React.

<h1> What is Intersection
Observer?
</h1>

<p>
The Intersection Observer API allows for asynchronous checking of the ratio of the intersection of an element with a viewport and will only fire a callback when the predefined threshold(s) are met. This has opened up many user experiences that were difficult to implement in a performant way, such as infinite scrolling, lazy load images, or delaying animations until visible..

<p>
The Intersection Observer API is a browser API which can be used to track the position of HTML elements in context to the actual viewport of the browser. The official documentation says: "The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport."
